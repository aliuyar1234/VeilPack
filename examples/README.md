# Examples

This directory contains runnable, opinionated demos that show VeilPack behavior with real inputs and expected outputs.

Available demos:
- `csv-redaction`: end-to-end CSV sanitization with a regex detector and strict policy.
- `pdf-redaction`: end-to-end searchable PDF sanitization (explicit opt-in via `limits.json` because PDF is disabled by default in `master`).
